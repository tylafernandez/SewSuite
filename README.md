# Tailor Web App: SewSuite

## About

This project is a comprehensive collaboration between Tyla Fernandez and Myles Petillo, aimed at building a robust web application for tailors and seamstresses. The goal is to streamline the process of tracking orders, managing client details, sending notifications, and handling payments—all within one intuitive platform.

Working from concept to execution, Tyla Fernandez will focus on the user experience (UX) design, front-end development, SQL database management, and prototyping in Figma. This ensures a seamless, user-friendly interface that prioritizes functionality and aesthetics for ease of use.

Myles Petillo will lead the back-end development, ensuring the app operates smoothly and efficiently behind the scenes. Together, we are committed to creating a powerful tool that helps professionals in the tailoring and sewing industry better manage their business operations, improve client communication, and simplify payments.

This collaborative project highlights both front-end and back-end expertise, working in harmony to bring a fully functional and scalable web app to life.

## Summary

This tool addresses a critical need in the tailoring and sewing industry, where many professionals still rely on manual methods to track orders, communicate with clients, and manage payments. By digitizing these processes, we're simplifying workflow management, improving client interactions, and helping users stay organized—ultimately saving time and reducing stress.

With this app, we aim to provide tailors and seamstresses with a comprehensive platform that enhances their productivity, ensures smooth communication, and integrates modern tools for better business management. It's an essential solution for professionals who want to focus more on their craft and less on the logistics.

## Goal

By streamlining order tracking, client management, communication, and payments, the app aims to reduce the time and effort spent on administrative tasks, allowing professionals to focus on their craft.

Key objectives include:
* **Simplifying workflow management** through an intuitive interface for tracking projects and deadlines.
* **Enhancing client communication** by sending automated notifications and updates via email or text.
* **Improving financial management** by integrating secure payment options for deposits and final payments.
